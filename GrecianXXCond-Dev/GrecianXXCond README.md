I will go through and regularize the stem weight a bit, and I will probablly regularize the the angles a bit... but I lind of like how the angles are not always 45 degrees, and how they are not symmetrical.

The caps also have a bit more contrast than the lc, this seems to happen allot in woodtype, where the Lc looks lighter than the UC. I'm thinking adding a little more weight to the verticals in the lc.

I'm using the Wm. H. Page version as a model.
